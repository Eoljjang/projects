### Notes
* Works best on desktop / laptop screens.
* Does work on mobile, just looks kinda weird. No official support yet.
* Created using CSS grid in combination with flexbox elements.
* Site is responsive / dynamic to viewport size.

## To-Do List
*More features will be added as I learn further skills*
- [x] Create structure
- [x] Create Styling
- [x] Add real projects to cards, make them clickable.
- [ ] Convert sidebar into a burger-menu shelf. 
- [ ] Mobile Support
- [ ] Can use search-bar to query the project cards (this will require a fair amount of refactoring).
- [ ] Can use "upload" button to add a new project card (same ^).
