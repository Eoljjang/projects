# Python Script File Organizer
This python script when executed, parses through all the files inside the downloads folder and sorts them into categorized sub-directories.

### Example
Say I have 4 files in my downloads folder:
- A folder named "junk"
- A JPG picture.
- A python file.
- A file with an unrecognized extension.

Running this script: *python3 main.py* sorts the above 4 files into the following folders (respectively):
1. Folders
2. Pictures
3. Code
4. Other

There are also remaining folders that are created but would be empty in this example:
5. Media
6. Documents
7. Packages
